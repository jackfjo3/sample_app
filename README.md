 Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).


Rather than using bitbucket and the IDE suggested in the tutorial, I am using github (obviously), as and Sublime Text 2 in OSX.  Much smoother so far.  Any discrepancies between the text and what happens in these environments will hopefully further my understanding as I solve any problems that may arise.
